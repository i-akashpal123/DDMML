We try to keep the atmosphere conducive to studying and resting and a couple of house-rules are in place to this end.  1. Towels and linens (sheets, blankets, and pillows) are NOT provided. The bed is twin size. 2. No smoking on the premises.  3. No loud music or TV etc.  4. Only for one person (no couples, no visitors). We seldom have visitors, let alone overnight guests. We know this will be a major turn-off to many people, but we believe we can find a like-minded roommate who can have fun outside the house.  5. If you are not sure about your check-out date, you can reserve the minimum days and extend your stay at a discounted rate.  6. Check-in time has to be coordinated at least 48 hours ahead.

This is my home and my sanctuary and I'm happy to share it with gentle people who are respectful of themselves and others. House goes quiet at 10 PM, and is smoke and drug-free always. Social drinking, especially with your meals, is A-OK. If you're a musician, you're welcome to use my gear, and we can even lay down a jam! Please note: We have clicked ""Hot Tub"" as an amenity because what we have, a jacuzzi-stye therapeutic bath, comes very close. Typically, Hot Tubs are big, hold 6-8 people and are out on the deck somewhere. What we have is a tub that makes serious bubbles with both water and air jets, and comes with a built-in customized 4-head shower. This tub also happens to be extra deep, extra wide, and extra long. You will love it!",
